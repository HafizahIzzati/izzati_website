	<p style="font-family: tahoma; text-align: center;">My family consists of three members only, my father, my mother and me. My father's name is Ahmad Sabrie bin Ishak. He works as a truck driver and was born on 17 June 1968. Born in the state of Pahang Darul Makmur. My mother's name is Zalina binti Sulaiman and she was born in Jerangau, Terengganu on January 1, 1977. Both of them are my backbone to succeed in this life. These people can be crowned as the best parents in this universe.
	<br>My father is strict in teaching me the meaning of life and guiding me with religious teachings from a young age. My mother, on the other hand, is a gentler person but still strict in educating me. I feel very happy and happy even being in this small family.</p>
